# Lesson 4: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform

## 1. Introduction to IaC Concepts

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is a practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. 

Key benefits of IaC:
- Consistency and reproducibility
- Version control and collaboration
- Automated deployment and scaling
- Documentation as code

## 2. Terraform Basics

Terraform is an open-source IaC tool created by HashiCorp. It allows you to define and provide data center infrastructure using a declarative configuration language.

Key Terraform concepts:
- Providers: Plugins for interacting with cloud providers, SaaS providers, and other APIs
- Resources: Infrastructure objects managed by Terraform
- State: Terraform's representation of your real infrastructure
- Modules: Reusable components of Terraform configurations

## 3. Writing Terraform Configurations

Terraform uses HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) for its configurations. Here's a basic example:

```hcl
# Configure the AWS Provider
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

# Create a VPC
resource "aws_vpc" "example" {
  cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"
  
  tags = {
    Name = "example-vpc"
  }
}

# Create a subnet within the VPC
resource "aws_subnet" "example" {
  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.example.id
  cidr_block = "10.0.1.0/24"

  tags = {
    Name = "example-subnet"
  }
}
```

## 4. Hands-on Exercise: Setting up a Web Server

Let's create a simple EC2 instance with a web server using Terraform.

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "web_server" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"  # Amazon Linux 2 AMI
  instance_type = "t2.micro"

  user_data = <<-EOF
              #!/bin/bash
              yum update -y
              yum install -y httpd
              systemctl start httpd
              systemctl enable httpd
              echo "<h1>Hello from Terraform</h1>" > /var/www/html/index.html
              EOF

  tags = {
    Name = "Terraform Web Server"
  }
}

output "public_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.web_server.public_ip
}
```

Exercise steps:
1. Save this configuration in a file named `main.tf`
2. Run `terraform init` to initialize the working directory
3. Run `terraform plan` to see the execution plan
4. Run `terraform apply` to create the resources
5. Visit the public IP (from the output) in your web browser to see the web server
6. Run `terraform destroy` when you're done to clean up resources

## 5. Managing State and Modules

### State Management

Terraform state is crucial for mapping real-world resources to your configuration. Best practices include:
- Using remote state (e.g., S3 backend for AWS)
- Enabling state locking to prevent concurrent modifications

Example of configuring a backend:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key    = "prod/terraform.tfstate"
    region = "us-west-2"
  }
}
```

### Modules

Modules in Terraform allow you to create reusable components. Here's a simple module structure:

```
modules/
  web_server/
    main.tf
    variables.tf
    outputs.tf
root_module/
  main.tf
```

Example usage of a module:

```hcl
module "web_server" {
  source = "./modules/web_server"
  
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  ami_id        = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
}
```

## 6. Real-world Case Study: Multi-tier Web Application

Imagine you're tasked with setting up infrastructure for a multi-tier web application with a frontend, backend, and database. You would use Terraform to:

1. Set up a VPC with public and private subnets
2. Create EC2 instances for the frontend in public subnets
3. Set up EC2 instances for the backend in private subnets
4. Create an RDS instance for the database in private subnets
5. Configure security groups and network ACLs
6. Set up an Application Load Balancer for the frontend

This showcases how Terraform can manage complex, multi-component infrastructures.

## 7. Quiz

1. What is the primary purpose of Infrastructure as Code?
2. What language does Terraform use for its configuration files?

5. How can you make your Terraform configurations more reusable?

Answers:
1. To manage and provision infrastructure through machine-readable definition files
