# Lesson 2: Advanced Command Line Usage

## 1. Pipes and Redirection

### Theoretical Explanation
Pipes and redirection are powerful features in Linux that allow you to chain commands together and manipulate input/output streams.

- Pipes (`|`) send the output of one command as input to another.
- Redirection operators (`>`, `>>`, `<`) allow you to redirect input/output to/from files.

### Hands-on Exercise
1. Use the `ls` command with `grep` to find all `.txt` files in the current directory:

```bash
ls | grep ".txt"
```

2. Redirect the output of `ls` to a file:

```bash
ls > file_list.txt
```

3. Append the result of `date` command to an existing file:

```bash
date >> log.txt
```

### Real-world Example
System administrators often use pipes and redirection to process log files. For instance, to find all error messages in a log file and save them to a new file:

```bash
grep "ERROR" /var/log/syslog > error_log.txt
```

## 2. Shell Scripting Basics

### Theoretical Explanation
Shell scripts are text files containing a series of commands that can be executed by a shell. They're useful for automating repetitive tasks.

### Hands-on Exercise
Create a simple backup script:

1. Open a new file called `backup.sh` in a text editor.
2. Add the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define source and destination directories
source_dir="/path/to/source"
backup_dir="/path/to/backup"

# Create timestamp
timestamp=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")

# Create backup
tar -czf "${backup_dir}/backup_${timestamp}.tar.gz" "${source_dir}"

echo "Backup created: backup_${timestamp}.tar.gz"
```

3. Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x backup.sh
```

4. Run the script:

```bash
./backup.sh
```

### Real-world Example
Many organizations use shell scripts for daily backups, log rotation, or system health checks.

## 3. Package Management

### Theoretical Explanation
Package managers are tools for installing, updating, and removing software on Linux systems. Common package managers include `apt` (Debian/Ubuntu) and `yum` (Red Hat/CentOS).

### Hands-on Exercise
Using `apt` on Ubuntu:

1. Update package list:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

2. Install a package (e.g., `nginx`):

```bash
sudo apt install nginx
```

3. Remove a package:

```bash
sudo apt remove nginx
```

### Real-world Example
DevOps engineers often use package managers in Dockerfiles or configuration management tools to ensure consistent software installations across environments.

## 4. Process Management and Monitoring

### Theoretical Explanation
Process management involves starting, stopping, and monitoring running processes on a Linux system.

### Hands-on Exercise
1. List all running processes:

```bash
ps aux
```

2. Find a specific process (e.g., nginx):

```bash
ps aux | grep nginx
```

3. Kill a process:

```bash
kill <PID>
```

4. Monitor system resources in real-time:

```bash
top
```

### Real-world Example
System administrators use process management tools to troubleshoot performance issues, identify resource-intensive applications, and ensure critical services are running.
