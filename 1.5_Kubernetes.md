# Lesson 5: Kubernetes (4-5 weeks)

## 1. Theoretical Explanations

### 1.1 Kubernetes Architecture and Components

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Its architecture consists of:

- Master Node components:
  - API Server
  - etcd
  - Scheduler
  - Controller Manager

- Worker Node components:
  - Kubelet
  - Container Runtime
  - Kube-proxy

### 1.2 Core Kubernetes Objects

- Pods: The smallest deployable units in Kubernetes
- Services: Abstractions that define a logical set of Pods and a policy to access them
- Deployments: Declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets

### 1.3 ConfigMaps and Secrets

- ConfigMaps: Used to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs
- Secrets: Similar to ConfigMaps but for storing sensitive information

### 1.4 Persistent Storage

- Persistent Volumes (PV)
- Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)
- Storage Classes

### 1.5 Helm

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that helps you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes applications.

### 1.6 Kubernetes Networking and Ingress

- Pod networking
- Service networking
- NetworkPolicies
- Ingress controllers and resources

## 2. Hands-on Exercises

### 2.1 Setting up a Kubernetes Cluster

```bash
# Using minikube for local development
minikube start

# Verify the cluster is running
kubectl cluster-info
```

### 2.2 Deploying a Simple Application

```yaml
# simple-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

Deploy the application:

```bash
kubectl apply -f simple-deployment.yaml
```

### 2.3 Creating a Service

```yaml
# nginx-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: LoadBalancer
```

Apply the service:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml
```

### 2.4 Using ConfigMaps and Secrets

Create a ConfigMap:

```bash
kubectl create configmap app-config --from-literal=APP_COLOR=blue --from-literal=APP_MODE=prod
```

Create a Secret:

```bash
kubectl create secret generic app-secret --from-literal=DB_Password=password123
```

### 2.5 Setting up Persistent Storage

```yaml
# pv-claim.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: mysql-data-claim
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
```

### 2.6 Installing a Helm Chart

```bash
# Add the bitnami repo
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami

# Install MySQL using Helm
helm install my-mysql bitnami/mysql
```

## 3. Real-world Example: Deploying a Microservices Application

Scenario: Deploy a simple e-commerce application consisting of a frontend service, backend API, and a database.

1. Create deployments for each component
2. Set up services to enable communication
3. Use ConfigMaps for application configuration
4. Use Secrets for database credentials
5. Set up an Ingress resource for external access
