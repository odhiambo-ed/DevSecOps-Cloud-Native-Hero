- [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) or [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/)
- Building CI/CD pipelines
- Automating deployments to Kubernetes
- Blue/Green and Canary deployment strategies

### 7. Monitoring and Logging (2-3 weeks)
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) for monitoring
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) for visualization
- [ELK stack](https://www.elastic.co/elk-stack) (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logging
- Implementing alerts and dashboards

### 8. Security and Compliance (2-3 weeks)
- DevSecOps principles
- Container and Kubernetes security best practices
- Cloud security and compliance
- Implementing security scanning in CI/CD pipelines

### 9. Advanced Topics and Best Practices (3-4 weeks)
- Microservices architecture
- Service mesh with [Istio](https://istio.io/)
- GitOps with [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- Chaos engineering
- Cost optimization in cloud environments

### 10. Real-world Projects (4-6 weeks)
- Design and implement a complete CI/CD pipeline for a microservices application
- Set up a production-grade Kubernetes cluster with monitoring, logging, and security
- Migrate a monolithic application to a cloud-native microservices architecture

## Additional Recommendations

Throughout this course plan, it's essential to:

- Practice regularly with hands-on exercises and projects
- Join DevOps and cloud-native communities (e.g., [Kubernetes Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com/), DevOps forums)
- Stay updated with the latest trends and best practices in the field
- Prepare for relevant certifications (e.g., Docker Certified Associate, [Certified Kubernetes Administrator](https://www.cncf.io/certification/cka/), AWS/Azure/GCP certifications)

## Duration and Pacing

This plan is designed to take approximately 6-8 months if studied part-time, but the duration can be adjusted based on your learning pace and available time. Remember to balance theoretical knowledge with practical application, and don't hesitate to work on personal projects to reinforce your learning.
