# Lesson 1: Understanding Linux Distributions and Their Role in DevOps

## 1. Theoretical Explanations

### What is Linux?
- Brief history of Linux
- Open-source nature and its importance

### Linux Distributions
- Definition of a Linux distribution
- Common components (kernel, package manager, desktop environment)
- Popular distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, Debian)

### Linux in DevOps
- Importance of Linux in server environments
- Automation and scripting capabilities
- Containerization support

## 2. Hands-on Exercises

1. Installing a Linux distribution in a virtual machine
   - Download and install VirtualBox
   - Download an Ubuntu ISO
   - Create a new VM and install Ubuntu

2. Exploring the Linux file system
   - Open a terminal
   - Navigate through directories using `cd`
   - List files and directories using `ls`
   - Identify key directories: `/etc`, `/home`, `/var`, `/opt`

3. Basic command practice
   ```bash
   # Create a directory
   mkdir my_project

   # Change to the new directory
   cd my_project

   # Create a file
   touch readme.txt

   # Edit the file
   nano readme.txt

   # List directory contents
   ls -l
   ```

## 3. Real-world Example: Netflix's Use of Linux

Netflix, a leading streaming service, heavily relies on Linux for its operations:
- Uses Ubuntu for its Open Connect appliances
- Leverages Linux for content delivery and streaming
- Utilizes Linux-based tools for monitoring and automation

This example demonstrates how a major tech company employs Linux in its DevOps practices for scalability and efficiency.
