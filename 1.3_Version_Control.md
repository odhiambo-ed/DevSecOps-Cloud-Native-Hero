# Lesson 3: Introduction to Version Control and Git Concepts

## 1. Theoretical Explanation

### What is Version Control?
Version control is a system that helps track changes to files over time. It allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously, maintain a history of changes, and revert to previous versions if needed.

### Why Use Version Control?
- Collaboration: Multiple developers can work on the same project without conflicts.
- History Tracking: Every change is recorded, allowing you to review or revert when necessary.
- Branching and Merging: Developers can work on different features in isolation and merge them later.
- Backup: Serves as a distributed backup of your project.

### Introduction to Git
Git is a distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. It's designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

### Key Git Concepts
1. Repository: A container for your project, including all files and their version history.
2. Commit: A snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time.
3. Branch: An independent line of development.
4. Remote: A common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes.
5. Clone: A copy of a repository on your local machine.
6. Pull: Fetching changes from a remote repository and merging them into your local repository.
7. Push: Sending your committed changes to a remote repository.

## 2. Hands-on Exercise

Let's create a new Git repository and make our first commit.

```bash
# Create a new directory
mkdir my_first_repo
cd my_first_repo

# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Create a new file
echo "Hello, Git!" > hello.txt

# Stage the file
git add hello.txt

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Initial commit: Add hello.txt"

# Check the status
git status

# View commit history
git log
```

## 3. Real-world Example: Linux Kernel Development

The Linux kernel, one of the largest open-source projects, uses Git for version control. Linus Torvalds created Git specifically for Linux kernel development. This system allows thousands of developers worldwide to contribute to the Linux kernel efficiently.

Key benefits for the Linux kernel project:
- Distributed nature allows for offline work
- Branching and merging support parallel development of features
- Fast performance even with large codebases
